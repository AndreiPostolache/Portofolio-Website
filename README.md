# I recently completed a Web Development Course at IT School, where I gained hands-on experience in Front-End Development, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS and frameworks like Bootstrap, Material UI. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge and hone my skills.

On this website, you will find a collection of my recent projects, showcasing my abilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS. From a Social Media App to a News Homepage, each project has been carefully crafted with attention to detail and a focus on creating a seamless user experience.

I am eager to start my career in web development and am excited about the opportunity to work with like-minded professionals. I am a quick learner, a problem-solver, and committed to delivering high-quality work that exceeds expectations.

I invite you to take a look at my portfolio and see for yourself the quality of work I bring to the table. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting my website!
