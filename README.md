## About



Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Andrei-Catalin Postolache, and I am a web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

On this website, you'll find examples of my work, showcasing my skills in creating modern and responsive websites. I've used CSS to create a variety of effects, including a jumping word animation and hover effects on project screenshots that allow users to view code and the live site. I also used CSS to create a sleek, modern-looking form that connects to a Google Spreadsheet via JavaScript.

Speaking of JavaScript, I've used it throughout the site to add functionality and interactivity. For example, I used it for form validation, ensuring that user input is accurate and complete. I've also used semantic HTML to create a website that is accessible and easy to navigate.

Whether you're a potential client or employer, I hope that you find my portfolio website to be a reflection of my skills and passion for web development. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for visiting my website!
